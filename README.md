# **Bookstore Web Application**

Live Link :https://book-store-app-7f2f.vercel.app/

This is a **full-stack dynamic and responsive web application** designed to showcase how to build a **Bookstore** project using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The application allows users to browse books, view book details, add books to their shopping cart, and perform user authentication to manage their accounts.

## **Features**
- **Browse Books**: Search and filter books by categories, authors, and titles.
- **Book Details**: View detailed information about each book, including price, description, and author.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add, remove, and manage items in the shopping cart.
- **User Authentication**: Sign-up, login, and user account management using **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for secure authentication.
- **Responsive UI**: Designed to be fully responsive for desktop and mobile users using **Tailwind CSS**.
- **Real-time Updates**: The cart and book information update in real-time as changes are made.
